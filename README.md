📝 Simple To-Do List Web App

This is a basic To-Do List application built using HTML ,  CSS , and  JavaScript**. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete (via a checkbox), and remove them. The main purpose of this project is to practice DOM manipulation and dynamic UI updates using JavaScript.


 🚀 Features

 ✅ Add new tasks dynamically.
 🗑️ Remove tasks from the list.
 ☑️ Custom-styled checkboxes for task tracking.
 🎨 Stylish and responsive design.


📁 Project Structure

├── index.html      # Main HTML file
├── style.css       # CSS styling
└── script.js       # JavaScript functionality

💻 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

  bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list.git
   cd todo-list
 

2. Open `index.html` in any browser:

   You can double-click the `index.html` file or run it using a live server extension in your code editor (like VS Code).

🧠 How It Works

* When the user enters a task and clicks the ADD  button:

  * JavaScript dynamically creates a list item (`<li>`).
  * A checkbox and a  Remove  button are also created and added with the task text.
* Each list item has:

  * A  checkbox  to visually mark the task.
  * A  Remove  button that deletes the task from the list.

🎨 Styling Details

* The app has a centered layout with a visually appealing color scheme.
* The input box and buttons have custom styles for better user experience.
* Task items are displayed with spacing and styled fonts.


This is a beginner-friendly project. Feel free to fork it and improve the features or UI.
